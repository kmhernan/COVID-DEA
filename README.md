# Differential expression of COVID-19-related genes in European Americans and African Americans
This file will provide instructions on how to reproduce the results described in the manuscript ["Differential expression of COVID-19-related genes in European Americans and African Americans"]().
All analysis were performed using [MetaOmGraph](https://github.com/urmi-21/MetaOmGraph) version 1.8.1. Violin plots were made using ggplot in R.

## Setting up tools and data
* Download MetaOmGraph from [here](http://metnetweb.gdcb.iastate.edu/MetNet_MetaOmGraph.htm). This will download a zip file. Unzip the file to get mog1.8.1.jar file.
* Download the Human cancer RNA-Seq mog project from [here](http://metnetweb.gdcb.iastate.edu/MetNet_MetaOmGraph.htm). This will download a zip file. Unzip the file to get a folder containing three files: Data file, Metadata file and MOG project file (.mog)
* MetaOmGraph user guide is available [here](https://github.com/urmi-21/MetaOmGraph/tree/master/manual)
